This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects I developed while assisting college students with their coursework, as well as assignments and projects from my own university studies. The projects cover a range of topics, including data analysis, automation, algorithms, and problem-solving, demonstrating my ability to write efficient and well-structured Python code.
